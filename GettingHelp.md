The first resource you should use is the tool-specific documentation.  You can read it in a couple of different ways:

  * With the --help command-line option.
  * With perldoc.  `perldoc mk-table-sync` will show documentation for mk-table-sync.
  * As a man page, if the man pages are installed on your system.  Try `man mk-table-sync`.
  * Online: http://www.maatkit.org/doc/mk-table-sync.html for example.
