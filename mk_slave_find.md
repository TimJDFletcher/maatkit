[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=label:Tool-mk_slave_find)

This tool is a proof of concept for finding slaves.  It works, but it can't really do anything with them.  Thus it is a solution in search of a problem.

However, it could be quite useful if it actually had the ability to **do** something with slaves it finds, such as execute a command upon them.
