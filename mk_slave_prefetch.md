This tool is interesting to certain people at large social networking sites.  I think it is likely to get some sponsorship.  But the general public has shown little interest, probably because very few workloads can actually benefit from it.  Still, there are a few quick wins that we should fix regardless of who wants them.

  * Fix the badly rewritten queries.
  * Fix the problem that causes relay logs not to be found.
