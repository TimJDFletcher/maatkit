# the version number of tools that have an "unfinished" Changelog, i.e. those
# that have had changes since last release.  Without --new, adds the comment
# to every Changelog.  This script used to then svn commit, but it no longer
# does this automatically--you should svn commit from /trunk after bumping the
# version.
