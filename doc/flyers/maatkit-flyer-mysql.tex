\normalsize
Maatkit makes hard things easy with powerful, high-quality command-line tools.
From data synchronization to query analysis, these tools are designed by and for
DBAs. You can use them for one-off jobs, or build scheduled tasks with them. See
the other side for more information on specific tools.

\section*{Powerful}
Maatkit tools follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing 
well.  All tools have consistent command-line options and
behavior.  And each tool's output is easy to use---for humans
\emph{and} for other command-line tools.

\section*{\LARGE What Can Maatkit Do For You Today?}
\normalsize
So, what does Maatkit \emph{do}?  It would take a book to answer that question
fully.  Here's a list of three essential activities for every MySQL DBA, and how
Maatkit makes them easy.  See \emph{http://www.maatkit.org/users} for success
stories from users such as Tuenti, Second Life, and more.

\section*{\includegraphics[width=1em]{../image/success} Verify Replication Integrity}

Do you use MySQL replication?  Are you sure that your slaves have a faithful
copy of their master's data?  If you haven't verified, you should!  You might be
surprised to find out that the slaves have become different from the
master.  Maatkit's \emph{mk-table-checksum} tool is the only way to check.  It
executes checksum queries against the master.  These queries propagate through
replication to the slaves, and then a simple query against the slaves can reveal
whether there are differences from the master.  The tool has smart features
that make everything as easy and efficient as possible for
the server and the DBA.  It's all wrapped up into one super-handy package.  And
if you find differences, the \emph{mk-table-sync} tool can fix them---without
even interrupting a production system!  Maatkit not only makes it possible for
you to verify replication integrity, it actually makes it easy!

\section*{\includegraphics[width=1em]{../image/success} Analyze Queries}

Quick, what are the most expensive queries running on your system?  Don't know?
Use the \emph{mk-query-digest} tool to find out easily!  It reads your server's
query log, and creates an amazing report that shows exactly what you
need to focus on---complete with a profile of the queries.  It can even store
the results in a database, where you can annotate them, query them with SQL,
mark them as ``reviewed'' so the tool won't show them to you again, and more.
Create a scheduled task to do this, and you'll get a report every day that shows
you what queries are ``new'' on your system---a great way to catch problem SQL
proactively.  It has tons of advanced features, including the ability to capture
queries from the network so you don't even have to enable logging.  Without a
doubt, \emph{mk-query-digest} is the most sophisticated log analysis tool 
for MySQL!

\section*{\includegraphics[width=1em]{../image/success} Test Changes Before
Deploying}

Wouldn't it be nice if you could test your changes before you deploy them, and
ensure that nothing bad is going to happen?  The \emph{mk-upgrade} tool can help
you execute queries against two systems and compare the results.  Use it before
you upgrade MySQL, to ensure there are no performance regressions, changes in
syntax, differences in query plans, new warnings or errors, and more.  Use it
before you change server settings, too!  It's a sensible way to be safe and
careful with changes to vital production systems.  If it helps Facebook, then
it can help you too!
