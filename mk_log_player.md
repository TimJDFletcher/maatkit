[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=label:Tool-mk_log_player)

This tool was built for a Percona client for stress-testing a high-performance MySQL appliance.  It was added to Maatkit because it was seen as generally useful, but there hasn't been much interest in it.  We have no plans to make any further changes unless someone wants that.
