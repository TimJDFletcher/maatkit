[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=label:Tool-mk_slave_delay)

This tool is stable and mature.  If practical, it would be nice to make it better-tested.  There is also a feature request on the issues list for a different kind of delay, which might be useful sometimes.  We might also integrate it with [mk\_heartbeat](mk_heartbeat.md).
