#summary Roadmap and vision for mk-profile-compact

[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=label:Tool-mk_profile_compact)

This tool is conceptually very simple, as a companion tool to [mk\_query\_profiler](mk_query_profiler.md), but it has two problems:

  1. The code is buggy.  It can crash in a variety of circumstances.
  1. Is the [mk\_query\_profiler](mk_query_profiler.md) tool even useful and necessary?  As I (Baron) have become more capable with MySQL, I've stopped using these tools and I don't really find them all that helpful anymore.

The roadmap for these tools is probably to start a conversation on the mailing list.
