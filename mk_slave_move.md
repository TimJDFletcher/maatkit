#summary Roadmap and vision for mk-slave-move

[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=label:Tool-mk_slave_move)

Like [mk-slave-find](mk_slave_find.md), this tool is mostly a solution in search of a problem, although it has more potential.  It needs

  * Better tests.
  * Some minor fixes to functionality.
  * The ability to move slaves around safely in a situation where data is changing.  (It's not clear if this is a problem or not right now.)
  * More functionality.  There are several TODO items in the tool itself.
