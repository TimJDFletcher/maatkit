[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=label:Tool-mk_visual_explain)

This is a mature and stable tool.  Very little change is needed, except that there's some small things someone could do if they fancy it.  The biggest thing would be building a web front-end or using mk-visual-explain in some other service to render nice EXPLAIN diagrams instead of tabular output.  There is a [thread on the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/maatkit-discuss/browse_thread/thread/a57b737b9e8a4d53) about this.

  * Output in dot format would be interesting.  See the above-mentioned thread.
  * Some deeper analysis is possible if the tool is able to query the MySQL server.
