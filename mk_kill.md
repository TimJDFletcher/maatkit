#summary Roadmap and vision for mk-kill

[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=label:Tool-mk_kill)

This tool was proposed in [issue 401](https://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/detail?id=401) and first released in Maatkit 4790.  It has basic functionality and tests.  There are some outstanding feature requests.

There is a [discussion thread](http://groups.google.com/group/maatkit-discuss/browse_thread/thread/e1c42882d716f0dd) about merging mk-kill and [mk-loadavg](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/wiki/mk_loadavg) into a single tool.  However, mk-kill seems so specialized that there isn't a good match.
