#summary Roadmap and vision for mk-duplicate-key-checker

[issues](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/list?q=tool-mk_duplicate_key_checker)

This tool began its life as a very simple one: find duplicate and redundant indexes and foreign keys.  It has become pretty complex. The plan is to make it more user-friendly, and eventually merge it into [mk-schema-advisor](mk_schema_advisor.md) and decommission it.
